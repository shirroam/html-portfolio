<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Shirley! I just graduated from my bachelors in Businesss Analytics at the Vrije Universiteit  of Amsterdam. 
  I am currently taking this Web Developmemt course because I have taken quite an interest in this field. Apart from 
  that, I believe it is always a good thing to learn new skills and improve yourself.</p>
