<hr />

<h3>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</h3>
<p>Long awaited sequel to the first movie and it did not dissapoint. Loved the soundtracks as well.</p>

<h3>Thor: Love and Thunder</h3>
<p>It was giving fairytale. Has to come second in this list, but was not the best compared to the other Thor movies.</p>

<h3>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h3>
<p>This movie was unnecessarily dark and devilish.</p>
